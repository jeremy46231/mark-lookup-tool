# Running Times Lookup

Try it at [running.jer.app](https://running.jer.app)!

This is a simple website to show the times for any runner. It works by accessing the internal APIs of [Athletic.net](https://athletic.net) and [MileSplit](https://milesplit.com) It works for most cross country or track events in the US (at least, I've never found one it couldn't find).
